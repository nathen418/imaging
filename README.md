# Ubuntu Virtual Machine Scripts
- Description: This repository contains some scripts that I have created that are useful for creating new Ubuntu virtual machines and performing common tasks

## How to run these scripts yourself:
- Clone this repository and run the script yourself or
```bash
sudo su -c "bash <(wget -qO- INSERT_SCRIPT_URL_HERE)" root  
```
THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU TRUST THE SCRIPT WRITER.
